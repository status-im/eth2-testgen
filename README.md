# Eth 2.0 test vectors generators

Test vectors generators based on the specifications at https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs.

## Implementation

As much as possible the generators copy-paste the specifications. If an example implementation
is not available in the specifications, the generator will be implemented using one of the
Ethereum Foundation library instead.
