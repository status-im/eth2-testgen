# Eth 2.0 test vectors generators

** Status: Deprecated **

Functionality has been upstreamed.
Head over to https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-tests for the test vectors
or https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-test-generators for their generators.

Test vectors generators based on the specifications at https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs.

## Getting Started

```
make
```

## Implementation

As much as possible the generators copy-paste the specifications. If an example implementation
is not available in the specifications, the generator will be implemented using one of the
Ethereum Foundation library instead.

## License

Similar to Eth 2.0 specifications, all code and generated test vectors
are public domain under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)
